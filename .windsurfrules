If a file gets above 200 lines of code - always break it up and modularize it into multiple files.
My build system is Vite, React, Tailwind CSS, Daisy UI, React Hot Toast, Framer Motion, and Supabase as the backend.
Always add a large amount of comments to your code so that it's easier to understand and maintain.
