# Changelog

All notable changes to the WNF project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Enhanced - July 17, 2025
- **Team Balancing Tier Visualization Improvements**:
  - Player names now appear directly under each specific tier when clicked (instead of at the bottom)
  - Multiple tiers can be expanded simultaneously for easier comparison
  - Added "Expand All" and "Collapse All" buttons for tier pyramid view
  - Each tier maintains its own animation state to prevent re-animation issues
  - Smooth Framer Motion animations restored with proper isolation
  - Improved user experience with individual tier control

- **True Snake Draft Implementation**:
  - Fixed tier-based team balancing to use proper snake draft pattern
  - Randomly selects which team picks first (different each time)
  - Teams alternate who picks first in each tier (true snake draft)
  - Prevents same team from always getting highest-rated player
  - Pre-calculates and prevents team size imbalances (e.g., 10v8)
  - Smart adjustments ensure teams differ by at most 1 player
  - Debug log shows random selection and any balance adjustments

### Fixed - June 30, 2025
- **Game IQ Team Balancing Issues**:
  - Fixed Game IQ ratings not being fetched from database in team balancing interface
  - Fixed all players showing Game IQ as "5" instead of actual database values

  - Added Game IQ improvements to Swap Suggestion cards
  - Updated team stats calculations to include avgGameIq and totalGameIq

### Enhanced - June 30, 2025
- **Team Balancing Algorithm Improvements**:
  - **Unknown Player Distribution**: Players with <10 games are now distributed evenly across teams
    - Added "NEW" badges for players with insufficient game history
    - Team headers show count of new players (e.g., "8 players, 3 new")
    - Prevents all unknowns clustering on one team which disabled win rate/goal differential metrics
  - **Deterministic Results**: Generate Optimal Teams now produces consistent results
    - Replaced random shuffling with deterministic optimization
    - Unknown players distributed based on their Attack/Defense/Game IQ ratings
    - Algorithm tries all possible distributions and selects the mathematically optimal one
  - **Confidence Score**: Added team balance confidence indicator
    - High (green): <25% unknown players
    - Medium (yellow): 25-50% unknown players
    - Low (red): >50% unknown players
    - Helps admins understand reliability of team balance

### Fixed - June 27, 2025
- **Player Rating Decimal Precision**: Fixed issue where average ratings were incorrectly stored as integers
  - Root cause: Bulk update during Game IQ implementation rounded most averages to whole numbers
  - Applied migration to recalculate all average ratings from individual ratings
  - Restored proper decimal precision (e.g., 5.71 instead of 6.0)
  - Affects `attack_rating`, `defense_rating`, and `game_iq` columns in players table

### Added - June 26, 2025

  - Database columns: `game_iq_rating` in player_ratings table
  - Database columns: `game_iq` and `average_game_iq_rating` in players table
  - Updated trigger function `update_player_average_ratings()` to calculate Game IQ averages
