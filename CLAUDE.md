# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Memories
- Run date via base before adding/editing any documentation to ensure you've got the correct date.
- Academy tier added (2025-06-18): Players with 0 caps and 0 XP are now "Academy" (deep teal gradient), while players with >0 caps and 0 XP remain "Retired" (black). This distinction helps differentiate new players from inactive ones.
- When the user wants to commit changes to GitHub, ask if they'd like to use the Git MCP server commands instead of bash git commands.
- Team Announcement Phase enhanced (2025-06-18): Now supports two-stage pasting - first paste player registration message, then team announcement message with ðŸŸ  Orange Team and ðŸ”µ Blue Team sections. Attack/Defense ratings removed from game creation form. Default pitch cost updated to Â£54.
