# Tier-Based Snake Draft Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a tier-based snake draft algorithm alongside the existing optimal team balancing algorithm. This allows comparison between two different approaches to team balancing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Algorithm Implementation
**File**: `src/components/admin/team-balancing/tierBasedSnakeDraft.ts`

#### Three-Layer Rating System (Updated 2025-01-17)
- **Layer 1: Core Skills (65%)**: Average of Attack, Defense, and Game IQ ratings
- **Layer 2: Derived Attributes (15%)**: Six attributes from playstyles (Pace, Shooting, Passing, Dribbling, Defending, Physical)
- **Layer 3: Performance Metrics (20%)**:
  - Track Record (12%): Career win rate and goal differential with exponential penalties for <30% win rate
  - Recent Form (8%): Last 10 games performance with momentum factor

#### Key Functions:
- `calculateThreeLayerRating()`: Computes adjusted player rating with skills, attributes, and performance
- `calculateTierSizes()`: Determines tier distribution (e.g., 4-4-3-4-3 for 18 players)
- `applySnakeDraft()`: Implements snake draft with team balance checks
- `optimizeTeams()`: Tier-constrained optimization starting from lowest tier
- `validateTierDistribution()`: Checks for count and quality concentrations in tiers
- `getTierDistributionIssues()`: Returns specific details about distribution problems
- `isSwapAcceptable()`: Improvement-aware validation for proposed swaps
- `trySameTierSwaps()`: Attempts swaps within the same tier
- `tryCrossTierSwaps()`: Attempts swaps between adjacent tiers

#### Fixes Applied:
- Fixed rating calculation formula to allow both positive and negative adjustments
- Fixed snake draft to ensure balanced teams (9v9 instead of 10v8)
- Added team balance check with automatic player redistribution
- Fixed win rate handling to support both percentage (0-100) and decimal (0-1) formats
- Fixed `get_player_recent_goal_differentials` RPC function (was checking for 'played' status instead of 'selected')
- Fixed optimization to start from Tier 5 and respect threshold stopping
- Fixed Final Rankings Summary to use sorted player array
- Updated to three-layer system with playstyle attributes (60/20/20 weighting, rebalanced 2025-09-08)
- Added tier distribution awareness to prevent extreme quality concentrations (2025-07-23)
- Changed balance threshold from 0.5 to 0.3 for better optimization control
- Implemented improvement-aware validation to allow beneficial swaps
- **2025-01-17 Improvements**:
  - Adjusted weight distribution: Skills 65%, Attributes 15%, Performance 20%
  - Implemented dynamic attribute balance thresholds based on improvement score
  - Added win rate gap consideration for threshold adjustments
  - Enabled multiple optimization rounds (up to 3) for cascading improvements
  - Enhanced debug logging with specific metric changes and rejection reasons
  - Fine-tuned thresholds: improvement >0.09 gets 1.1 threshold (was 1.0)
  - Win rate penalty only applies when gap >10% AND worsens significantly

### 2. Data Structure Updates
**File**: `src/components/admin/team-balancing/types.ts`

Added fields to `TeamAssignment` interface:
```typescript
overall_win_rate?: number | null;        // Career win rate
overall_goal_differential?: number | null; // Career goal differential
derived_attributes?: {                   // From playstyle ratings
  pace: number;
  shooting: number;
  passing: number;
  dribbling: number;
  defending: number;
  physical: number;
} | null;
```

### 3. Data Fetching Updates
**File**: `src/components/admin/team-balancing/useTeamBalancing.ts`

Modified to fetch both overall and recent stats:
- Uses `get_player_win_rates()` for career stats
- Uses `get_player_recent_win_rates()` for last 10 games
- Uses `get_player_recent_goal_differentials()` for recent goal differentials
- Fetches `player_derived_attributes` for playstyle-based attributes
- Properly handles null values for players with insufficient games
- Unrated players default to 0 for all attributes (not 0.35)

### 4. UI Components

#### TierBasedTeamGenerator
**File**: `src/components/admin/team-balancing/TierBasedTeamGenerator.tsx`
- Shows tier distribution with player ratings
- Displays confidence level based on unknown players
- Added "View Debug Log" button for detailed algorithm output

#### TeamAlgorithmComparison
**File**: `src/components/admin/team-balancing/TeamAlgorithmComparison.tsx`
- Side-by-side comparison of both algorithms
- Shows balance scores and player movements
- Indicates which algorithm produces better balance

### 5. Enhanced Debug Logging
The debug log now provides comprehensive insights with improved formatting and analysis:

#### Key Sections:
1. **Executive Summary** - Quick overview with algorithm type, player count, tier distribution, final balance, and team advantage
2. **Performance Categories Legend** - Explains rating categories and momentum indicators upfront
3. **Condensed Rating Summary** - Shows player transformations in a compact, easy-to-scan format
4. **Visual Snake Draft** - Improved visualization with flow arrows showing the snake pattern between tiers
5. **Team Balance Breakdown** - Detailed comparison of skills and performance metrics
6. **Team Strength Comparison** - Shows which team has advantages in each metric
7. **Optimization Impact Summary** - Details swaps made and quantifies improvement
8. **Key Decisions** - Explains WHY specific swaps improved balance with skill comparisons
9. **Draft Value Analysis** - Identifies best picks and potential reaches
10. **Team Composition by Tier** - Visual distribution using emojis (üîµüü†)

## Database Migrations

### Fixed Recent Goal Differentials Function
**Migration**: `fix_recent_goal_differentials_status_check`

The `get_player_recent_goal_differentials` function was returning empty results because it was checking for `status = 'played'` when the actual status in the database is `'selected'`. This has been fixed.

## Usage

1. Navigate to Admin Portal ‚Üí Team Balancing
2. Click "Generate Optimal Teams" for the existing algorithm
3. Click "Generate Tier-Based Teams" for the new algorithm
4. Compare results in the comparison section
5. Click "View Debug Log" to see detailed algorithm execution

## Algorithm Behavior

### How Attack/Defense/Game IQ Are Used

The algorithm uses individual skill ratings in two distinct ways:

1. **For Player Ranking (Transformation Phase)**:
   - Attack, Defense, and Game IQ are averaged equally: `(Attack + Defense + Game IQ) / 3`
   - This creates a single "base skill rating"
   - The base skill is then transformed using performance metrics

2. **For Team Balance (Optimization Phase)**:
   - Attack, Defense, and Game IQ are kept separate
   - Team averages are calculated for each skill independently
   - Balance score = maximum difference across all three skills
   - This ensures teams are balanced in all dimensions, not just overall rating

### Snake Draft Fairness
- The starting team is randomly selected each time teams are generated
- This prevents the same team from always getting the highest-rated player
- The alternating pattern ensures fair distribution of picks across all tiers

### Three-Layer Rating Example
```
Player: Simon
  Base Skill: Attack=8.0, Defense=7.9, Game IQ=8.8
  Base Skill Rating: 8.24 (average of three skills)
  Overall Stats: Win Rate=59.30%, Goal Diff=35
  Recent Stats: Win Rate=60.00%, Goal Diff=15
  Overall Performance Score: 0.670
  Recent Form Score: 0.682
  Momentum: 0.012 (steady)
  Momentum Adjustment: 0.000
  Three-Layer Rating: 9.10 (adjusted from 8.24)
```

### Snake Draft Process
The draft follows a true snake pattern with alternating first picks per tier:
- **Initial Pick**: The team that picks first in Tier 1 is randomly selected each time
- **Alternation**: The team that picks first alternates with each tier (regardless of player count)
- **Pattern**: If Blue picks first in Tier 1, Orange picks first in Tier 2, Blue in Tier 3, etc.

Example visualization (Blue randomly selected to pick first):
```
Randomly selected Blue team to pick first

Tier 1: ‚Üí Simon(B) ‚Üí Jarman(O) ‚Üí Daniel(B) ‚Üí Michael D(O) ‚Üò
Tier 2: Tom K(O) ‚Üê Dom(B) ‚Üê Paul(O) ‚Üê Dave(B) ‚Üê
        ‚Üì
Tier 3: ‚Üí Joe(B) ‚Üí Lewis(O) ‚Üí Phil R(B) ‚Üò
Tier 4: Darren W(O) ‚Üê Chris H(B) ‚Üê Jack G(O) ‚Üê Lee M(B) ‚Üê
        ‚Üì
Tier 5: ‚Üí Stephen(B) ‚Üí Zhao(O) ‚Üí James H(B)
```
The arrows (‚Üí, ‚Üê, ‚Üò, ‚Üì) show the draft flow between and within tiers. Notice how the first pick alternates: Blue‚ÜíOrange‚ÜíBlue‚ÜíOrange‚ÜíBlue.

### Team Size Balancing
The algorithm ensures teams are always balanced (9v9 for 18 players, or differ by at most 1 for odd totals):
- **Pre-calculation**: Simulates the standard snake draft to detect potential imbalances
- **Target Size**: Each team targets `totalPlayers / 2` (rounded down)
- **Smart Adjustments**: In final tiers, if teams differ by 2+ players, the algorithm adjusts who picks first
- **Hard Limits**: No team can exceed the target size - remaining picks go to the smaller team

Example with 4-4-3-4-3 configuration:
```
Randomly selected Orange team to pick first
Target team size: 9 players each (18 total)

Warning: Standard snake draft would create imbalance (Blue: 8, Orange: 10)
Adjusting draft pattern to ensure balanced teams...

Tier 4 Draft:
  Blue picks first
  [Adjusted to Blue first to balance teams]
  Pick 1: Player ‚Üí Blue
  ...
  Current totals: Blue 8, Orange 8

Tier 5 Draft:
  Orange picks first
  Pick 1: Player ‚Üí Orange
  Pick 2: Player ‚Üí Blue
  Pick 3: Player ‚Üí Orange (Blue team full)
  Current totals: Blue 9, Orange 9
```

### Tier-Constrained Optimization
```
TIER-CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION PHASE
Current Balance: 1.143
Threshold: 0.3
Integrated same-tier and cross-tier swaps, starting from lowest tier

Optimizing Tier 5:
  Blue: Maddocks
  Orange: James H, Mike M
  [attempts swaps within tier, then cross-tier with Tier 4]

Optimizing Tier 4:
  Blue: Zhao, Calvin
  Orange: Stephen, Darren W
  [stops when balance ‚â§ 0.3 threshold]
```

### Tier Distribution Awareness (Added 2025-07-23)

The algorithm now includes sophisticated tier distribution validation to prevent extreme quality concentrations:

#### Key Features:
1. **Quality Concentration Detection**: Identifies when one team gets all the worst players in a tier
2. **Improvement-Aware Validation**: Allows swaps that don't worsen existing concentrations
3. **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Shows detailed tier distribution status and rejection reasons

#### How It Works:

**Validation Functions**:
- `validateTierDistribution()`: Checks for both count and quality concentrations
- `getTierDistributionIssues()`: Provides specific details about distribution problems
- `isSwapAcceptable()`: Improvement-aware validation that compares before/after states

**Quality Concentration Rules**:
- For tiers with 3+ players and rating spread > 1.2 points
- Prevents one team from getting all bottom players (lowest 2 in tier)
- Example: In Tier 5 with Maddocks (4.53), James H (3.87), Mike M (3.10)
  - Spread: 4.53 - 3.10 = 1.43 (> 1.2 threshold)
  - Bottom players: James H, Mike M
  - Rejected if one team would get both

**Improvement-Aware Logic**:
- ‚úÖ **Allowed**: Swaps that fix or don't affect existing concentrations
- ‚úÖ **Allowed**: Swaps where the same concentration remains (doesn't worsen)
- ‚ùå **Blocked**: Swaps that create new concentrations
- ‚ùå **Blocked**: Swaps that worsen existing concentrations

**Debug Log Example**:
```
Initial Tier Distribution: CONCENTRATED (Orange would get all bottom players in Tier 5: James H, Mike M)
Trying Zhao ‚Üî Stephen: balance 0.360 ‚Üí 0.159 (improves by 0.201) ‚Üí ACCEPTED
Final Tier Distribution: CONCENTRATED (Orange would get all bottom players in Tier 5: James H, Mike M)
```

This ensures both statistical balance AND perceptual fairness in team composition.

### Dynamic Attribute Balance Thresholds (Added 2025-01-17)

The algorithm now uses dynamic thresholds that adapt based on the potential improvement from a swap:

#### Threshold Calculation
```typescript
const getAttributeBalanceThreshold = (improvement: number, winRateGapBefore: number = 0, winRateGapAfter: number = 0): number => {
  let baseThreshold: number;
  if (improvement > 0.2) {
    baseThreshold = 1.5;  // Very permissive for major improvements
  } else if (improvement > 0.09) {
    baseThreshold = 1.1;  // Moderately permissive
  } else if (improvement > 0.05) {
    baseThreshold = 0.85; // Slightly permissive
  } else {
    baseThreshold = 0.5;  // Standard threshold for minor changes
  }

  // Only penalize if gap exceeds 10% AND worsens significantly
  if (winRateGapAfter > 10 && winRateGapAfter > winRateGapBefore * 1.5) {
    baseThreshold *= 0.75;
  }
  return baseThreshold;
};
```

#### Benefits
- **Adaptive Acceptance**: More lenient for swaps that significantly improve balance
- **Win Rate Protection**: Prevents creating large competitive gaps between teams
- **Cascading Improvements**: Multiple optimization rounds can find secondary improvements

## Key Differences from Original Algorithm

1. **Player Evaluation**: Uses three-layer system with momentum (65/15/20 weights) vs five equal metrics
2. **Team Formation**: True snake draft with randomized initial pick vs exhaustive search
3. **Performance**: O(n log n) vs O(2^n) complexity
4. **Philosophy**: Ensures tier distribution vs pure statistical balance
5. **Optimization**: Tier-constrained with dynamic thresholds, allows multiple rounds
6. **Skill Usage**: Averages skills for ranking, but keeps them separate for balance checking
7. **Fairness**: Random team selection for first pick ensures different patterns each week

## Momentum Factor

### How It Works
- Compares recent form (last 10 games) to overall career performance
- Identifies players on hot streaks or cold streaks
- Hot streaks: 5% bonus (recent > overall) - reduced from 10%
- Cold streaks: 3% penalty (recent < overall) - reduced from 5%

### Categories
- **Hot (üî•)**: Recent performance significantly better than overall
- **Cold (‚ùÑÔ∏è)**: Recent performance significantly worse than overall  
- **Steady (‚óè)**: Recent performance similar to overall

### Example Impact (with Conservative Weights)
```
Player: Daniel
  Overall: 46% win rate
  Recent: 60% win rate
  Momentum: +0.17 (hot streak)
  Rating boost: +0.38 points (down from +0.58 with old weights)
```

### Weight Comparison
**Old Weights (60/20/20)**:
- More volatile transformations with attributes having high impact
- Could create excessive adjustments based on playstyles

**Current Weights (65/15/20) - Updated 2025-01-17**:
- Base skills more dominant (65%) to prioritize core abilities
- Reduced attribute weight (15%) prevents playstyle from overshadowing skill
- Maintained performance weight (20%) for meaningful win rate/goal diff impact
- Enhanced performance penalties for catastrophic players (<30% win rate)
- Statistical z-score scaling makes attributes league-relative rather than pure positive adjustments

## Known Issues Resolved

1. **Win Rate Format**: Now handles both percentage (0-100) and decimal (0-1) formats
2. **Goal Differentials**: Fixed RPC function to use correct status filter
3. **Rating Formula**: Fixed to allow both positive and negative adjustments
4. **Optimization Order**: Fixed to start from Tier 5 (lowest) upwards
5. **Threshold Stopping**: Optimization stops when balance ‚â§ 0.3

## Statistical Scaling Calibration Fix (2025-09-08)

### Problem Identified
The original attribute implementation suffered from a critical calibration issue where all players received positive attribute adjustments instead of a realistic mix of positive and negative adjustments. This occurred because attributes provided pure positive scores (0-1 scale) rather than league-relative adjustments.

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Before Fix**: Simple division by 10 (`attributesScore / 10`) created adjustments ranging only ¬±0.001 to ¬±0.004
- **Impact**: Insignificant adjustments that didn't meaningfully differentiate players
- **Universal Positive Bias**: All players saw rating increases, disrupting the intended balance

### Statistical Solution Implemented
#### Z-Score Based Scaling
```typescript
// NEW: League-relative statistical approach
function calculateLeagueAttributeStats(players: TeamAssignment[]) {
  const attributeScores = players.map(p => calculateAttributeScore(p.derived_attributes));
  const average = attributeScores.reduce((sum, score) => sum + score, 0) / attributeScores.length;
  const variance = attributeScores.reduce((sum, score) => sum + Math.pow(score - average, 2), 0) / attributeScores.length;
  const standardDeviation = Math.sqrt(variance);
  return { average, standardDeviation, min: Math.min(...attributeScores), max: Math.max(...attributeScores) };
}

// Enhanced attribute adjustment calculation
if (attributeStats.standardDeviation > 0) {
  const zScore = (attributesScore - attributeStats.average) / attributeStats.standardDeviation;
  const cappedZScore = Math.max(-2, Math.min(2, zScore)); // Cap at ¬±2 standard deviations
  attributesAdjustment = cappedZScore * 0.15; // Range: ¬±0.3
}
```

#### Key Improvements
1. **League-Relative Adjustments**: Players now receive adjustments based on how they compare to league average
2. **Meaningful Impact**: Adjustments now range ¬±0.05 to ¬±0.3 (50-75x more impactful)
3. **Balanced Distribution**: Creates natural mix of positive and negative adjustments
4. **Statistical Rigor**: Uses standard deviations to ensure fair scaling across different attribute distributions

### Enhanced Performance Penalties
- **Exponential Penalties**: Players with <30% win rate now receive exponential performance penalties
- **Weight Rebalancing**: Increased performance weight from 10% to 20% to ensure catastrophic performers still get meaningful penalties
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Balance thresholds now adapt based on team characteristics rather than static 0.3

### Results Achieved
- **Before**: All players received positive adjustments (¬±0.001 to ¬±0.004)
- **After**: Realistic mix of positive and negative adjustments (¬±0.05 to ¬±0.3)
- **User Feedback**: Confirmed as "SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT!" with properly calibrated attribute impact

## Formation Suggestions

### Overview
After teams are selected through the tier-based snake draft, the Formation Suggester system automatically analyzes each team's composition and assigns players to optimal tactical positions based on their playstyle attributes.

### Integration with Team Balancing

The formation system operates as the final phase of team generation:

1. **Team Selection**: Tier-based snake draft creates balanced teams
2. **Composition Analysis**: Each team's playstyles are analyzed
3. **Formation Selection**: Appropriate tactical formation chosen (3-2W-2-1, 3-4-1, etc.)
4. **Position Assignment**: Players assigned to positions matching their attributes
5. **Optimization**: Intelligent swaps to improve tactical fit
6. **Visual Output**: Formation displayed in pitch view with player positions

### How Formations Are Selected

The system analyzes the collective playstyles of each team:

- **Attacking Heavy** (many Hunters, Finishers, Marksmen):
  - Selects 3-1-3-1 or 3-1-2-2 formations
  - Emphasizes ST and CAM positions

- **Defensive Heavy** (many Sentinels, Anchors, Shadows):
  - Selects 3-2W-2-1 with CDM emphasis
  - Prioritizes DEF and CDM positions

- **Balanced Mix**:
  - Selects 3-4-1 or standard 3-2W-2-1
  - Even distribution across positions

### Position Assignment Algorithm

#### Three-Phase Process
1. **Natural Fits**: Players with natural positions assigned first (e.g., "Finisher" ‚Üí ST)
2. **Best Available**: Remaining players matched by attribute compatibility
3. **Forced Assignments**: Any leftovers placed in least-bad positions

#### Critical Mismatch Handling
- Identifies terribly misplaced players (score < 2.0)
- Prioritizes fixing these through intelligent swaps
- Example: Tom K (Finisher) misplaced at CM gets swapped to ST

### Debug Integration

The consolidated debug log includes formation information:
```
=== FORMATION SELECTION ===
BLUE: 3-2W-2-1
  Reasoning: 3 attacking, 2 defensive, 4 balanced players
  Composition: 3 ATK, 2 DEF, 4 BAL
  Playstyle Coverage: 9/9

=== PLAYER ASSIGNMENTS ===
  ‚úì Stephen (6.6/3.7/5.1) [PAC:1.0 SHO:0.7]
    Style: Hunter | Score: 5.45 | Natural position fit (Phase 1)
```

### Visual Display

The team balancing page shows:
- **Formation Overview**: Pitch visualization with player positions
- **Position Details**: Expandable sections for each position
- **Area Strength**: Defensive, Midfield, Attack balance scores
- **Assignment Notes**: Reasoning for position decisions

### Benefits of Formation Integration

1. **Tactical Awareness**: Teams aren't just balanced statistically, but tactically coherent
2. **Position Optimization**: Players placed where their attributes are maximized
3. **Visual Clarity**: Clear representation of team structure
4. **Strategic Planning**: Helps teams understand their tactical approach
5. **Automatic Adaptation**: Formations adjust to available player types

### Configuration

The formation system uses:
- **6 Derived Attributes**: Pace, Shooting, Passing, Dribbling, Defending, Physical
- **Position Weights**: Customizable requirements for each position
- **Relative Requirements**: Dynamic thresholds based on player pool
- **Swap Optimization**: Intelligent position exchanges to improve fit
