# Vercel Analytics Integration

## Overview
This document describes the integration of Vercel Analytics into the WNF application. Vercel Analytics provides insights into user behavior, page performance, and other metrics to help improve the application.

## Implementation Details
Vercel Analytics has been integrated into the WNF application using the official `@vercel/analytics` package. The integration was completed on 29 May 2025.

### Package Installation
The `@vercel/analytics` package was installed via npm:

```bash
npm install @vercel/analytics
```

### Integration in the Application
The Analytics component is added at the root level of the application in `App.tsx`:

```tsx
import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react'

// ... other imports

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      {/* ... other components */}
      <Analytics />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  )
}
```

## Features and Benefits
- **Automatic Page View Tracking**: Tracks page views as users navigate through the application
- **Performance Monitoring**: Provides insights into page load times and other performance metrics
- **User Behavior Analysis**: Helps understand how users interact with the application
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Access to a real-time dashboard in the Vercel platform

## Configuration Options
The Analytics component can be configured with various options:

```tsx
<Analytics 
  debug={false} // Enable debug mode for development
  beforeSend={(event) => {
    // Modify or filter events before they're sent
    return event;
  }}
/>
```

## Privacy Considerations
- Vercel Analytics complies with GDPR and other privacy regulations
- User data is anonymized by default
- Users can opt out of analytics tracking through browser settings
