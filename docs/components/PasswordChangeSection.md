# PasswordChangeSection Component

## Overview
The `PasswordChangeSection` component provides a user interface for changing passwords. It renders a form that allows users to input their current password and a new password (with confirmation), validates the inputs, and submits the change request to the backend.

## Component Structure

```tsx
export default function PasswordChangeSection({ onClose }: PasswordChangeSectionProps)
```

### Props
- `onClose`: Function to call when the user closes the password change section or completes the password change process

## Features

### Form Fields
The component renders a form with the following fields:
- Current Password: For verifying the user's identity
- New Password: For setting the new password
- Confirm New Password: For ensuring the new password is entered correctly

### Validation
The component performs client-side validation including:
- Ensuring all fields are filled
- Verifying that the new password and confirmation match
- Checking that the new password meets minimum security requirements

### State Management
The component manages several pieces of state:
- Form field values
- Validation errors
- Loading state during submission
- Success/error messages

### Visual Feedback
- Loading indicators while processing the request
- Success message upon successful password change
- Error messages for validation failures or API errors

### Animations
The component uses Framer Motion for smooth enter/exit animations, enhancing the user experience when the password change section appears and disappears.

## Technical Implementation

### Form Handling
The component uses controlled form inputs, with state variables tracking each input's value and validation status.

### API Integration
The component makes API calls to Supabase authentication services to:
1. Verify the current password
2. Update the password if validation passes

### Error Handling
The component provides descriptive error messages for various failure scenarios:
- Empty fields
- Password mismatch
- Invalid current password
- API failures

### Styling
The component uses Tailwind CSS for styling, with a responsive design that works well on both mobile and desktop viewports.

## Usage Example

```tsx
// In Profile.tsx
import { AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion'
import PasswordChangeSection from '../components/profile/PasswordChangeSection'

// Component state
const [showPasswordReset, setShowPasswordReset] = useState(false)

// Render section when needed
<AnimatePresence mode="wait">
  {showPasswordReset && (
    <PasswordChangeSection 
      onClose={() => setShowPasswordReset(false)} 
    />
  )}
</AnimatePresence>
```

## Animation Details
The component uses Framer Motion's `motion.div` for animations with the following properties:
- Initial state: Slide in from the right with opacity 0
- Animate state: Full opacity with normal position
- Exit state: Slide out to the right with fading opacity
- Transitions: Smooth easing functions with appropriate duration

These animations provide visual continuity as the section appears and disappears, improving the overall user experience.

## Accessibility Considerations
- Form labels are properly associated with their inputs
- Error messages are descriptive and visible
- The component can be dismissed with a clearly visible close button
- Focus management follows logical tab order
