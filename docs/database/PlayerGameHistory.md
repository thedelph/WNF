# Player Game History System

## Overview
The player game history system maintains a materialized view (`public_player_game_history`) that tracks player participation in games. This view is automatically refreshed through database triggers whenever game registrations change.

## Materialized View

### `public_player_game_history`
A materialized view that provides efficient access to player game history data.

#### View Details
- **Schema**: public
- **Owner**: postgres
- **Content**: Contains player_id, game sequence_number, and registration status
- **Purpose**: Provides quick access to historical game participation data

## Database Triggers

### `refresh_game_history_trigger`
This trigger automatically refreshes the player game history materialized view when game registrations change.

#### Trigger Details
- **Table**: `game_registrations`
- **Events**: AFTER INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- **Function**: `refresh_player_game_history()`
- **Security**: SECURITY DEFINER (runs with owner privileges)

#### Technical Implementation
The trigger function:
- Runs with SECURITY DEFINER to ensure proper permissions
- Automatically refreshes the materialized view
- Executes after any changes to game registrations
- Returns NULL to complete the trigger operation

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.refresh_player_game_history()
RETURNS trigger
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = public
AS $$
BEGIN
  REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW public_player_game_history;
  RETURN NULL;
END;
$$;
```

## Security Considerations
- The materialized view is owned by postgres
- The refresh function runs with SECURITY DEFINER to ensure proper permissions
- Authenticated users have SELECT permission on the view
- The function's search_path is explicitly set to public for security

## Performance Impact
- The materialized view is refreshed synchronously after each game registration change
- Consider the performance impact on high-frequency registration updates
- Future optimizations might include:
  - Asynchronous refresh mechanisms
  - Partial refresh strategies
  - Scheduled batch updates

## Related Components
- Game registration system
- Player history displays
- Statistics calculations

## Maintenance
- Monitor the size of the materialized view
- Consider periodic cleanup of historical data
- Watch for performance impacts during high-volume registration periods
