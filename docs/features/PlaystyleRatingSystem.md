# Playstyle Rating System Implementation (v2.0)

## Overview
A hybrid playstyle system that combines the best of predefined names with dynamic attribute selection. Players select attributes directly through checkboxes, and the system either shows a predefined playstyle name (like "Hunter", "Engine") or generates a descriptive name for new combinations. This system complements the existing Attack/Defense/Game IQ ratings with 6 derived attributes (Pace, Shooting, Passing, Dribbling, Defending, Physical) for enhanced team balancing and player profiling.

**Status**: Live for all users (as of 2025-09-17)

## System Design

### Core Concepts
- **Checkbox-first approach** - Select attributes directly, get playstyle name
- **Hybrid naming system** - 24 predefined names + dynamic generation for other combinations
- **Independent 1.0 weights** - Each attribute gets full weight (no percentage splitting)
- **63 total combinations** - All possible attribute combinations supported
- **6 derived attributes** calculated from attribute selections
- **Default baseline** of 0 for all attributes (unrated players start at zero)
- **Attributes are averaged** across all ratings a player receives
- **Available to all users** (was beta-restricted until 2025-09-17)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Attribute Calculation Logic
```typescript
// For each player:
// 1. Get all ratings with playstyles
// 2. Sum attribute weights from each playstyle
// 3. Divide by number of ratings
// 4. Store in player_derived_attributes table

Example:
Player rated 3 times:
- Rating 1: Maestro (shooting: 0.67, passing: 0.67, dribbling: 0.67)
- Rating 2: Engine (pace: 0.67, passing: 0.67, dribbling: 0.67)
- Rating 3: Sniper (shooting: 1.0, dribbling: 1.0)

Final attributes:
- Pace: (0 + 0.67 + 0) / 3 = 0.22
- Shooting: (0.67 + 0 + 1.0) / 3 = 0.56
- Passing: (0.67 + 0.67 + 0) / 3 = 0.45
- Dribbling: (0.67 + 0.67 + 1.0) / 3 = 0.78
- Defending: 0
- Physical: 0
```

### Integration with Existing System
- **Existing ratings remain primary**: Attack/Defense/Game IQ are skill levels
- **Playstyles are modifiers**: Show HOW players use their skills
- **No double-counting**: Defending attribute doesn't add to Defense rating
- **Fair defaults**: Unrated players get 0 for all attributes
- **Open to all users**: All players can now assign playstyles when rating

## Attribute-Based Filtering Feature

### How It Works
1. Click "Filter by attributes" above the playstyle dropdown
2. Select which attributes the player has (e.g., Pace, Dribbling)
3. The dropdown filters to show only playstyles containing ALL selected attributes
4. Shows count of matching playstyles (e.g., "Showing 3 playstyles with pace + dribbling")

### Example
Selecting "Pace + Dribbling" shows:
- **Speedster** (exactly those two attributes)
- **Engine** (has both plus Passing)
- **Complete Forward/Box-to-Box** (all-rounders with everything)

This makes it easier to find the right playstyle based on your assessment of the player.

## Version 2.0 Changes (Current)

### Major Updates
1. **Checkbox-first UI** - Select attributes directly, playstyle name is generated
2. **Independent 1.0 weights** - Each attribute gets full weight, no percentage splitting
3. **Hybrid naming** - Keeps 24 predefined names, generates names for 39 new combinations
4. **No versatility penalty** - Players with more attributes get higher totals (fair representation)
5. **Binary key mapping** - Fixed incorrect mappings (e.g., Sentinel vs Enforcer)
6. **Team balancing update** - Normalized for 0-6 attribute range instead of fixed 2.0

### Key Benefits
- **More intuitive** - Check what you see, get appropriate name
- **Fair scoring** - Versatile players no longer penalized
- **Unlimited combinations** - All 63 possible combinations supported
- **Preserves familiarity** - Classic names like "Hunter" and "Engine" retained
- **Future-proof** - Easy to add new predefined names if patterns emerge

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Single rating per player** - More intuitive, rate what you see
2. **Zero default baseline** - Unrated players start at 0, must earn attributes through ratings  
3. **Independent weights** - Each attribute gets 1.0 (not percentage-based)
4. **Hybrid naming** - Best of both worlds (predefined + dynamic)
5. **Attributes as tendencies, not additional skills** - Avoids double-counting
6. **General availability** - Released to all users (was beta-restricted until 2025-09-17)
7. **63 total combinations** - Complete coverage of all possibilities

## Formation Integration

### How Playstyles Map to Tactical Positions
The 6 derived attributes are now the primary input for the Formation Suggester system, which automatically assigns players to optimal tactical positions based on their playstyle characteristics.

#### Natural Position Detection
Each playstyle maps to one or more natural positions:

| Playstyle Category | Example Styles | Natural Positions | Key Attributes |
|-------------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Attacking** | Hunter, Finisher, Marksman | ST (Striker), W (Winger) | Shooting, Pace, Dribbling |
| **Creative** | Maestro, Artist, Deadeye | CAM (Attacking Mid) | Passing, Dribbling, Shooting |
| **Box-to-Box** | Engine, Box-to-Box | CM (Central Mid), W | Pace, Passing, Dribbling |
| **Defensive Mid** | Powerhouse, Locomotive | CDM, CM | Defending, Physical, Passing |
| **Defensive** | Sentinel, Anchor, Shadow | DEF, CDM | Defending, Physical, Pace |

#### Position Suitability Calculation
Each position has weighted attribute requirements:

```typescript
// Example: Striker position weights
ST: {
  shooting: 0.35,    // 35% - Primary requirement
  pace: 0.25,        // 25% - Get in behind defenses
  dribbling: 0.20,   // 20% - Beat defenders 1v1
  physical: 0.10,    // 10% - Hold up play
  passing: 0.05,     // 5%  - Link-up play
  defending: 0.05    // 5%  - Pressing
}
```

#### Formation Selection Based on Team Composition
The system analyzes the collective playstyles to choose formations:
- **Many attacking playstyles** → 3-1-3-1 or 3-1-2-2 (attack-heavy)
- **Many defensive playstyles** → 3-2W-2-1 with CDM emphasis
- **Balanced mix** → 3-4-1 or 3-2W-2-1

#### Dynamic Assignment Algorithm
1. **Phase 1**: Players with natural positions are assigned first (e.g., "Finisher" → ST)
2. **Phase 2**: Remaining players assigned based on attribute compatibility
3. **Phase 3**: Optimization through intelligent position swapping
4. **Critical Fixes**: Players terribly misplaced (score < 2.0) get priority swaps

### Integration Benefits
- **Automatic position detection** - No manual position assignments needed
- **Tactical flexibility** - Formations adapt to available playstyles
- **Optimized team balance** - Players placed where attributes are maximized
- **Visual feedback** - Debug logs show exactly why positions were assigned

### Usage in Team Balancing
After teams are selected via tier-based snake draft:
1. Each team's playstyle composition is analyzed
2. Appropriate formation is selected
3. Players are assigned to positions based on attributes
4. Swaps optimize overall team tactical fit
5. Visual formation display shows final assignments
