# Playstyle Rating System Implementation

## Overview
Adding a playstyle system to complement the existing Attack/Defense/Game IQ ratings. Players can select one playstyle when rating another player, which derives 6 additional attributes (Pace, Shooting, Passing, Dribbling, Defending, Physical) for enhanced team balancing and player profiling.

## System Design

### Core Concepts
- **One playstyle per rating** (not three separate categories)
- **21 total playstyles** across 3 categories (Attacking, Midfield, Defensive)
- **6 derived attributes** calculated from playstyle selections
- **Default baseline** of 0.35 for all attributes (ensures unrated players aren't disadvantaged)
- **Attributes are averaged** across all ratings a player receives

### Playstyle Categories & Definitions

   - Monitor trigger function performance
   - Gather user feedback on playstyle selections

## Technical Implementation Details

### Attribute Calculation Logic
```typescript
// For each player:
// 1. Get all ratings with playstyles
// 2. Sum attribute weights from each playstyle
// 3. Divide by number of ratings
// 4. Store in player_derived_attributes table

Example:
Player rated 3 times:
- Rating 1: Maestro (shooting: 0.8, passing: 0.8, dribbling: 0.8)
- Rating 2: Engine (pace: 0.8, passing: 0.8, dribbling: 0.8)
- Rating 3: Sniper (shooting: 1.0, dribbling: 1.0)

Final attributes:
- Pace: (0 + 0.8 + 0) / 3 = 0.27
- Shooting: (0.8 + 0 + 1.0) / 3 = 0.60
- Passing: (0.8 + 0.8 + 0) / 3 = 0.53
- Dribbling: (0.8 + 0.8 + 1.0) / 3 = 0.87
- Defending: 0
- Physical: 0
```

### Integration with Existing System
- **Existing ratings remain primary**: Attack/Defense/Game IQ are skill levels
- **Playstyles are modifiers**: Show HOW players use their skills
- **No double-counting**: Defending attribute doesn't add to Defense rating
- **Fair defaults**: Unrated players get 0.35 for all attributes

## Next Steps to Complete

1. **Install chart library**:
   ```bash
   npm install recharts
   ```

2. **Create RadarChart component**:
   - Build reusable radar chart for player profiles
   - Normalize values (0-3 range to 0-10 for display)
   - Support multiple player overlay

3. **Update team balancing**:
   - Modify balance score calculation
   - Add style diversity checks
   - Prevent teams of all similar playstyles

4. **Test the system**:
   - Run migration: `npx supabase db push`
   - Test rating flow with playstyles
   - Verify attribute calculations
   - Test radar chart visualization

5. **Deploy**:
   - Push migration to production
   - Update documentation
   - Notify users of new feature

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Single playstyle per rating** (not 3) - More intuitive, rate what you see
2. **0.35 default baseline** - Ensures fairness for unrated players
3. **Balanced styles in all categories** - Every category has a "Complete" option
4. **Weights balanced around 2.0-2.4 total** - Specialization slightly rewarded
5. **Attributes as tendencies, not additional skills** - Avoids double-counting

## Notes for Continuation

- The foundation is solid - database and basic UI are working
- Main focus should be on visualization (radar charts) and team balancing integration
- Consider adding playstyle analytics (most common styles, style by position, etc.)
- Could extend to show playstyle badges on player cards
- Future: Hybrid styles or position-specific weightings
