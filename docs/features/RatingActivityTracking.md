- Last 10 rating activities across all players
- Visual change indicators for rating updates
- Time since activity (e.g., "2 hours ago")

### Change Indicators
Visual feedback for rating changes:
- **ðŸŸ¢ â†‘ +X**: Green arrow with positive value for increases
- **ðŸ”´ â†“ -X**: Red arrow with negative value for decreases
- **No indicator**: First-time rating or no change

Example display:
```
