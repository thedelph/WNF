# Team Balancing System

## Overview
The team balancing system ensures fair and competitive matches by automatically distributing players across two teams (Blue and Orange) based on multiple performance metrics.

## Balancing Metrics (Updated September 8, 2025)

The system now considers **5 core metrics** plus **derived attributes** from playstyles:

1. **Attack Rating** (0-10 scale)
   - Measures offensive capabilities
   - Based on player ratings from teammates

2. **Defense Rating** (0-10 scale)
   - Measures defensive capabilities
   - Based on player ratings from teammates

3. **Game IQ Rating** (0-10 scale) *(NEW)*
   - Measures tactical awareness, positioning, and decision-making
   - Based on player ratings from teammates

4. **Win Rate** (0-100%)
   - Calculated from recent games
   - Only included for players with 10+ games

5. **Goal Differential**
   - Average goal difference from recent games
   - Only included for players with 10+ games

6. **Derived Attributes** (from Playstyles)
   - **Pace**: Speed and acceleration
   - **Shooting**: Finishing and shot power
   - **Passing**: Vision and passing accuracy
   - **Dribbling**: Ball control and agility
   - **Defending**: Tackling and positioning
   - **Physical**: Strength and stamina
   - Automatically calculated from player playstyle ratings
   - Unrated players default to 0

## Algorithm (Updated September 8, 2025)

### Three-Layer Rating System (Tier-Based Snake Draft)
When using the tier-based algorithm, player ratings are calculated with:
- **Layer 1 (60%)**: Core skills (Attack/Defense/Game IQ)
- **Layer 2 (20%)**: Derived attributes from playstyles
- **Layer 3 (20%)**: Performance metrics (12% track record + 8% recent form)

> **Note**: The weight distribution was rebalanced on September 8, 2025, reducing derived attributes from 30% to 20% and increasing performance metrics from 10% to 20%. This change was accompanied by a statistical scaling calibration fix that replaced simple attribute adjustments with z-score based scaling, creating more meaningful and balanced attribute impacts.

### Two-Phase Optimization Approach

#### Phase 1: Unknown Player Distribution
Players with <10 games ("unknowns") lack win rate and goal differential data. The algorithm:
1. Separates players into unknown (<10 games) and experienced (≥10 games) groups
2. Finds the optimal distribution of unknowns based on Attack/Defense/Game IQ
3. Evaluates all possible distributions and selects the best one

#### Phase 2: Experienced Player Optimization
1. With unknowns optimally pre-distributed, optimizes experienced player placement
2. Uses all 5 metrics for evaluation
3. Selects the combination with the lowest overall balance score

### Balance Score Calculation

#### Optimal Algorithm
For experienced players (all 5 core metrics):
```javascript
balanceScore = (attackDiff * 0.20) + 
               (defenseDiff * 0.20) + 
               (gameIqDiff * 0.20) +
               (winRateDiff * 0.20) + 
               (goalDiffDiff * 0.20)
```

For unknown players (3 metrics only):
```javascript
balanceScore = (attackDiff + defenseDiff + gameIqDiff) / 3
```

### Deterministic Results
- Same input always produces the same output
- No randomization involved
- Consistent team configurations

### Visual Indicators
- **"NEW" badge**: Players with <10 games
- **Team headers**: Show count of new players
- **Confidence score**: 
  - 🟢 High (<25% unknowns)
  - 🟡 Medium (25-50% unknowns)
  - 🔴 Low (>50% unknowns)

### Swap Recommendations
The system can suggest player swaps to improve balance:
- Calculates improvement for each possible swap
- Prioritizes swaps with the highest improvement
- Shows which metric benefits most from each swap

## UI Components

### Team Stats Display
Shows for each team:
- Average Attack, Defense, and Game IQ ratings
- Win Rate percentage
- Goal Differential
- Balance score breakdown by metric

## Alternative Algorithm: Tier-Based Snake Draft

### Overview
An alternative team balancing approach that uses a tier-based snake draft system. This algorithm:
- Groups players into skill tiers based on a three-layer rating system
- Uses a snake draft pattern with randomized starting team
- Ensures balanced team sizes through smart adjustments

### Key Features
1. **Three-Layer Rating System**:
   - Core Skills (60%): Average of Attack, Defense, and Game IQ
   - Derived Attributes (20%): Six attributes from playstyles (Pace, Shooting, Passing, Dribbling, Defending, Physical)
   - Performance Metrics (20%): Career win rate and goal differential (12%) + recent form with momentum factor (8%)

2. **True Snake Draft**:
   - Randomly selects which team picks first
   - Alternates first pick between tiers (e.g., Blue→Orange→Blue→Orange)
   - Prevents the same team from always getting the highest-rated player

3. **Team Size Balancing**:
   - Pre-calculates potential imbalances
   - Adjusts pick order in final tiers if needed
   - Ensures teams differ by at most 1 player

4. **Tier-Constrained Optimization**:
   - Only allows same-tier player swaps
   - Preserves tier distribution while improving balance

### When to Use
- When you want to ensure fair distribution of skill levels
- When tier-based team composition is important
- For a more transparent, draft-style team selection

## Best Practices

1. **Rating Requirements**
   - Ensure players have been rated by multiple teammates
   - Encourage honest, fair ratings

2. **Statistical Significance**
   - Win rate and goal differential require 10+ games
   - Players with fewer games use default values

3. **Manual Intervention**
   - Use sparingly to maintain algorithm integrity
   - Document reasons for manual changes

- Player chemistry considerations
- Historical performance trends
- Machine learning optimization
