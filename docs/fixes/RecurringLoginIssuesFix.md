# Recurring Login Issues Fix

## Problem
Two users repeatedly experience login failures after deployments, with the system claiming their username or password is incorrect. The issue persists even after password resets and only affects these specific users.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue is related to session token persistence and refresh token invalidation during deployments. When the app is redeployed:
1. Existing sessions may become invalid
2. Refresh tokens stored in the browser may not be properly refreshed
3. The Supabase auth state can become corrupted for specific users

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Supabase Dependencies
- Upgraded from `@supabase/supabase-js: ^2.46.1` to `^2.57.4`
- Includes numerous bug fixes for session management

### 2. Session Recovery System (`/src/utils/sessionRecovery.ts`)
- **Versioned Token Storage**: Detects and clears stale tokens from previous deployments
- **Deployment Detection**: Tracks deployment changes and automatically attempts recovery
- **Automatic Recovery**: Implements exponential backoff retry mechanism
- **Session Health Monitoring**: Tracks authentication failures and success patterns

### 3. Enhanced Authentication Hook (`/src/hooks/useAuth.ts`)
- **Recoverable Error Detection**: Identifies JWT expiration and refresh token issues
- **Session Health States**: `healthy`, `degraded`, `unhealthy`
- **Automatic Recovery Attempts**: Tries to restore sessions on initialization
- **Diagnostic Logging**: Enhanced logging for problematic users

### 4. Improved Login Experience (`/src/pages/Login.tsx`)
- **Session Recovery Banner**: Visual feedback for session issues
- **Magic Link Fallback**: Alternative authentication method for affected users
- **Enhanced Error Messages**: Specific guidance for recurring issues
- **Session Diagnostics**: Debug information for troubleshooting

### 5. Admin Diagnostic Tools (`/src/pages/admin/SessionDiagnostics.tsx`)
- **User Search**: Find users by email to check their session status
- **Magic Link Generation**: Send magic links directly to affected users
- **Password Reset**: Force password reset with fresh tokens
- **Session Clearing**: Clear all sessions for a user (super admin only)
- **Session Health Status**: Visual indicators for user session health

## How to Use

### For Users Experiencing Issues

1. **Clear Browser Data** (first attempt):
   - Clear cookies and localStorage for your app domain
   - Try logging in again

2. **Use Magic Link** (if password fails):
   - On the login page, if you see the "Alternative Login Method" section
   - Click "Send Magic Link to Email"
   - Check your email and click the link

3. **Request Password Reset**:
   - Click "Forgot Password" on the login page
   - This will clear any corrupted auth data

### For Administrators

1. **Access Session Diagnostics**:
   - Go to Admin Portal â†’ Session Diagnostics
   - Search for the affected user by email

2. **Send Magic Link** (recommended first step):
   - Click "Send Magic Link" button
   - User receives email with one-click login

3. **Force Password Reset**:
   - Click "Reset Password" button
   - User receives password reset email

4. **Clear All Sessions** (last resort):
   - Available to super admins only
   - Forces user to re-authenticate on all devices

### Identifying Problem Users

To identify which users are experiencing issues:

1. Check Supabase Auth logs for repeated failed login attempts
2. Look for patterns in the session diagnostics:
   - Users with `sessionHealth: 'unhealthy'`
   - High `failureCount` in session health data
   - Last successful auth > 1 hour ago with recent attempts

3. Add their emails to the `problemUserEmails` array in `/src/pages/Login.tsx`:
```typescript
const problemUserEmails = [
  'user1@example.com',
  'user2@example.com'
]
```

## Prevention

### For Future Deployments

1. **Monitor Auth Logs**: Check Supabase auth logs after deployment
2. **Test with Problem Users**: Have affected users test login immediately after deployment
3. **Use Magic Links Proactively**: Send magic links to known problem users before they report issues

### Long-term Solutions

1. **Session Migration**: The recovery system now handles deployment transitions
2. **Token Versioning**: Prevents old tokens from causing issues
3. **Health Monitoring**: Tracks and reports session health metrics

## Technical Details

### Session Storage Structure
```typescript
{
  version: "1.0.0",        // Token version for compatibility
  session: Session,        // Supabase session object
  timestamp: number,       // When session was stored
  deploymentId: string     // Unique deployment identifier
}
```

### Recovery Flow
1. Check stored session version and deployment ID
2. If mismatch detected, attempt refresh with old token
3. If refresh fails, try automatic recovery with backoff
4. Clear session and require fresh login if all recovery fails

### Session Health Metrics
- Tracks consecutive failures
- Records last successful authentication
- Monitors time since last successful auth
- Provides diagnostic data for troubleshooting

## Monitoring

The system now provides several monitoring points:

1. **Console Logs**: Enhanced logging for auth issues (search for "Login failed - diagnostics")
2. **Session Health Data**: Stored in localStorage as `wnf_session_health`
3. **Admin Dashboard**: Session Diagnostics tool shows user session status
4. **User Feedback**: Recovery banner shows session health status

## Rollback Plan

If the solution causes issues:

1. Revert the package.json changes
2. Remove the sessionRecovery.ts file
3. Revert useAuth.ts to previous version
4. The system will fall back to default Supabase auth behavior

## Future Improvements

1. **Automated Alerts**: Send alerts when multiple users experience auth issues
2. **Session Analytics**: Track session health metrics over time
3. **Proactive Recovery**: Detect deployment and pre-emptively refresh sessions
4. **User Communication**: Automated emails to affected users during issues
